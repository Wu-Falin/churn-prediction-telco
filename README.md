# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Telco Case Study

Predicting customer churn is essential for subscription-based businesses. This project analyzes customer data from a telco company to uncover churn patterns and build a predictive machine learning model.

## 🔍 Objective

- Identify patterns and behaviors that correlate with customer churn.
- Predict customers likely to churn using a classification model.
- Recommend retention strategies based on insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Tenure** is the top churn indicator — most churn happens early.
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** churn the most.
- **Higher monthly charges** increase churn likelihood.
- Online Security and Internet Type also play major roles.
